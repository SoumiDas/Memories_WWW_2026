## Code repository for accepted paper at The Web Conference 2026 : The Algorithmic Self-Portrait: Deconstructing Memory in ChatGPT

This is the code repository for our research paper on ChatGPT memories.

Structure:
- Analysis of ToM Categories in ChatGPT Memories (Figure 1): `/01_memories_and_mental_states`
- Analysis of User-Initiated vs. Model-Initiated Memories (Figure 2): `/02_user_agency`
- Analysis of Personal and Special Category Data Types (Figure 3): `/03_sensitive_information`
- Analysis of Provenance of Memories from User Messages (Figure 4): `/04_provenance_of_memories`
- Training and Inference of the Reverse Engineering Memories (Section 7): `/05_reverse_engineering_memories`



While we cannot share the data due to privacy and IRB restrictions, we provide the code to reproduce all plots from the paper.
We provide (AI-generated) dummy data in `/dummy_data` to give an idea of the underlying data structures needed for analysis.
